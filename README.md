# PinPoint
PinPoint will let you store map-locations (together with notes and pictures) of places that you visit.

## About
Offline mode will be made available first where all "pinpoints" are stored locally. They can still be shareable to others by sharing the Google maps location of said place.

With online mode you should be able to see pinpoints by other users if made public.

## Stack
Using Flutter and eventually Firebase.

## Why?
Travis got tired of screenshotting locations on google maps app and thought that it would be better to store them in one place. This app could also serve as a great learning opportunity of app development in general.
